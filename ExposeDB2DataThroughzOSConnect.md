# 5. Expose DB2 data through z/OS Connect

- ## Creating a DB2 Service

  - To verify that REST Services have been installed on your system, you can enter this into the address for your browser: [http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/](http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/). There will be a result on the screen showing something like the box below:<br/>
    ![DB2 Service Install Check](doc/source/images/DB2ServiceInstallCheck.png)<br/>
    _REST services for DB2 are defined either using a DB2 provided REST administrative service (DB2ServiceManager) or by using the DB2 BIND command using an update provided in DB2 PTF UI51748. There instructions walk through doing so using the RESTful administrative service._

  - Open the REST Client tool of your choice (for example, we will be usign a Firefox browser plug-in).

  - Choose the Header with a **Content-Type** of **application/json**
    ![REST Client Request Header](doc/source/images/RESTClientRequestHeader.png)

  - Choose the POST method and use the url <br/> http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/DB2ServiceManager

  - Modify the following stanza with the values for your service and paste it into the Body section (be sure to keep the requestType as "createService"):
    ![Modified Stanza](doc/source/images/ModifiedStanza.png)

  - Click **SEND**
    ![Click SEND](doc/source/images/ClickSEND.png)

  - If the command works, you will get an HTTP 201 response (which means that the call was successful and something was created).

  - In the Response, the new url for the service you created will be listed.
    ![RequestResponseForNewService](doc/source/images/RequestResponseForNewService.png)

  - You have just created a service.

    _Note: If you want to verify that the service exists later, you can use that same url that was listed in the verification step (http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/) to show you the services that exist on your DB2 system._

  - ### Testing a DB2 Service

    If you want to see if this service call works, you can do so with the REST client.

    - Make sure to use the POST method and the Header with Content-Type of application/json
    - Copy the url for the service and paste it into the URL field (you can get this from the listing of services using the note above)
    - Include any parameters you need to pass for the service in the "Body" section.
    - Click SEND
      ![Testing A DB2 Service](doc/source/images/TestingADB2Service.png)

  - ### Deleteing a DB2 Service

    If you made a mistake when you created your service or need to delete it for any reason, modify the stanza below and follow the first 5 parts of the Creating a DB2 Service step.
    ![Deleting a DB2 Service](doc/source/images/DeletingADB2Service.png)

- ## Creating a .sar file

  - In order to turn your new service into an API using z/OS Connect, the service needs to have a Service Archive (.sar) file. The .sar file has the json request and response schemas for the service as well as information about invoking it. <br/><br/> To create the .sar file for a DB2 service, the **z/OS Connect Build Toolkit** utility (**zconbt**) must be used. The utility can be installed on z/OS or on a Windows workstation. There instructions walk through using it on Windows.

  - ### Installing the Build Toolkit

    Locate the zconbt.zip file and unzip it into the directory of your choice. (That's all you need to do.) Make note of the directory where you unzipped it for future reference.
    ![Installing the Build ToolKit 1](doc/source/images/InstallingTheBuildToolkit1.png)
    ![Installing the Build ToolKit 2](doc/source/images/InstallingTheBuildToolkit2.png)

  - ### Creating the files needed for the Build Toolkit

    - There are three files that are used by the build toolkit to create the .sar file - a properties file, a json request file and a json response file.

      - The json request and json response files must be created manually. This is done by copying the json request and response schema entries from the service description.

      - The properties file can be created by copying a sample file and editing it.

    - Open a browser and start the REST Client plugin.

    - Use the header with Content-type of application/json and choose the **GET** method.

    - Place the url for invoking the service in the URL field and click **SEND**. (Make sure the Body area of the form is blank.)
      ![CreatingTheFilesForBuildToolKit1](doc/source/images/CreatingTheFilesForBuildToolkit1.png)

    - **Creatign the json files**

      - The json information for the request and response is in the response body for the invoked call. Select the entire area behind the words **"Request Schema"**: (including brackets) and **Copy** it.
        ![JSON Info in Response Body](doc/source/images/JSONInfoInResponseBody.png)

      - On your workstation, open a blank document (such as notepad) and **paste** the text into it.
        ![Paste Text Into Notepad](doc/source/images/PasteTextIntoNotepad.png)

      - Choose/create a destination folder and **Save** the document as **\<serviceName>Request.json**
        ![Save Your JSON](doc/source/images/SaveYourJSON.png)

      - Return to the browser and select the area behind the words "**Response Schema":** (including brackets) **Copy** it.

      - On your workstation, open a blank document (such as notepad) and **paste** the text into it.

      - Choose a destination folder and **Save** the document as **\<serviceName>Response.json**
        _Note: you can either save these files in the zconbt/bin directory or include the path to the directory when creating your properties file._

    - **Now, it's time to create the properties file.**

      - _You can find a sample properties file in the \<path to zconbt>/samples/service folder. The correct one for DB2 rest service is named sample_restClient_sar.properties_
        ![Sample Propertiesf File Location](doc/source/images/SamplePropertiesFileLocation.png)

      - If you are doing this for the firs time, **right click** on the **sample_restClient_sar.properties** file and choose **Open With**. It is recommended that you use WordPad (easiest method to view/edit).

      - In the sample file, definitions of the fields are listed.
        ![Editing the Sample Properties File](doc/source/images/EditingSamplePropertiesFile.png)

      - Edit the sample file to match the specifications for your new service. Guidance is included in the sample file. Some additional notes:

        - The service name shoould be the same as the name of the service from the "Creating a DB2 Service" part.
        - For consistency, the json request and response files should be named \<serviceName>\_request.json and \<serviceName>\_response.json
        - You can obtain portions of this value from your service URL that was called earlier during testing. Commonly, this would be /service/serviceName.
        - This value is your choice, but will also be used in the server.xml file.

      - Chose **File** -> **Save As** and save the file with a new name. _Note the folder where you saved the file for use in the zconbt script._
        - _Note: Place this file in the same folder as the json files or include the path to the .json files in the properties file._

    - **Run the zconbt tool to generate the .sar file.**

      - Open a DOS command prompt in Adminstrator Mode.

      - Use the change directory command to go to directory \<path to zconbt>\bin

      - Run the command: <br/>
        `zconbt --properties=<path to properties file>\<properties file name> --file=<path to sar file>\<sar file name>`
        <br/>_It is recommended to name your sar file \<serviceName>.sar_
        ![Command Prompt zconbt](doc/source/images/CommandPromptZCONBT.png)

    - If you get a response like "Successfully created service", then your .sar file is created. You are now ready to move to API creation.

- ## Creating the API

  - So far, you have created your DB2 REST Service and the Service Archive File that describes the service. As a reminder, a REST Service can only do the POST method. To provide additional functionality, we will be creating a REST API.

    - _To create the API, you need to have the z/OS Connect REST API Toolkit installed. This is an Eclipse plug-in that can be obtained here: http://ibm.biz/zosconnect-tooling-download
      <br/>These instructions assume that the z/OS Connect API Toolkit is already installed and ready to use._

  - ### Create a new API Project in the API Toolkit.

    - Start Eclipse and choose the z/OS Connect Perspective
      ![z/OS Connect Perspective Button](doc/source/images/zOSConnectPerspectiveButton.png)

    - Choose **File -> New -> Project**
      ![z/OS Connect New Project](doc/source/images/zOSConnectProjectButton.png)

    - At the popup window, choose **z/OS Connect API Project**
      ![Popup z/OS Connect API Project](doc/source/images/PopupChoosezOSConnectAPIProject.png)

    - Enter your choice of values for the fields (with some guidance below)

      - **Project Name** with just be the name of the collection that appears in the Project Explorer area. It does not relate to the API function.
      - In **API name**, the value is typically the same as the Service name in the .properties file (Marked with an "a" in the "Creating a .sar file section)
      - In **Base Path**, enter a value relevant to the API call you are making. This will be a permanent part of the API.
        ![z/OS Connect API Project Properties](doc/source/images/zOSConnectAPIProjectProperties.png)

    - A tab should appear in the center section of the window. You have now created a Project.
      ![Project Created Page](doc/source/images/ProjectCreatedPage.png)

  - ### Import .sar file into the API Toolkit.

    - In order to create an API, the tool must first have the artifacts for the service. Those artifacts have been bundled into a .sar file using the Build Toolkit and must now be imported into the workspace.

    - Remaining in the z/OS Connect Perspective, right click on the API name listed in Project Explorer. Then choose **z/OS Connect EE -> Import z/OS Connect EE Services**
      ![Import a z/OS Connect Service](doc/source/images/ImportzOSConnectService.png)

    - A window will pop up. Click the **File System** button.
      ![Click the File System Button](doc/source/images/FileSystemButton.png)

    - Navigate to the location where you saved the .sar file. Choose it and click **Open**

    - In the Import Service window, click **OK**
      ![Import Service Window](doc/source/images/ImportServiceWindow.png)

    - In the Import z/OS Connect EE Services window, click OK. You will then be returned to the blank project.
      ![Import z/OS Connect EE Services Window](doc/source/images/ImportzOSConnectEEServicesWindow.png)

  - ### Begin creating the API

    - Click the red **X** next to the methods you don't plan to use.
      ![Delete X for API Methods](doc/source/images/DeleteXAPIMethods.png)

    - Under **Path**, begin creating your URI parameters that will be called. (A clue for this may be found in the json request schema. What field is being passes?)
      ![API URI Setup](doc/source/images/APIURISetUp.png)

    - Click the **Service** button to associate the service you created earlier with this API call.

    - A pop up window will appear. Your service will likely be listed. If so, click it and then click **OK**.
      ![URI Popup Window](doc/source/images/URIPopupWindow.png)

    - Save what you have so far by holding **CTRL** and **S** keys

    - Click the Mapping -> Open Request Mapping to begin matching fields in your API path to the fields in your service.
      ![Open Request Mapping Button](doc/source/images/OpenRequestMappingButton.png)

    - Now, click the path field on the left and hold the mouse button down as you drag the cursor over the matching value on the right. A line should appear as you do this. When the field on the right blinks yellow, you can let go. The "wire" should remain with the word "Move" in the middle. Now your fields are matched. Continue doing this for each of the fields in your reqest path.

      - _Refer to additional [z/OS Connect Toolkit documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4SVW_beta/designing/api_mapping_editor.html) for additional operations such as assigning values to fields and removing fields._
        ![API Mapping Tool](doc/source/images/APIMappingTool.png)

    - When you have made all the connections, **Save** (CTRL+S) your mapping. Close the tab for the mapping.

    - If you are returning all the fields of your query, then you dont need to do anything to your Response mapping.

      - _Refer to additional z/OS Connect Toolkit documentation for additional operations such as removing fields_

    - You have now created the API. Next, deploy your API to the z/OS Connect Server.

  * ### Deploy the API to the z/OS Connect Server

    - In the _Projects Explorer_ view (left), right-mouse click on the project folder, then select **z/OS Connect EE -> Deploy API to z/OS Connect EE Server**.
      ![Deploy to Server Menu](doc/source/images/DeployToServerMenu.png)

    - A popup window will appear for you to choose the server for deployment. <br/> _(If the icon next to the sever name is green, then you are connect to the server and will be able to deploy. If not, click on the icon to connect.)_ <br/> Confirm the API name and other information and click **OK**. <br/>
      ![API Deployment Popup](doc/source/images/APIDeploymentPopup.png)

    - A confirmation window will appear. Click **OK**. <br/>
      ![DeploymentConfirmationPopup](doc/source/images/DeploymentConfirmationWindow.png)
      - _The .aar file for the API has automatically been generated and placed in the right location in the z/OS Connect file system for use._

* ## Registering the Service and the API in the z/OS Connect Server

  - In order to run your DB2-based API on z/OS Connect, some entries must be made in the **server.xml** file. These entries describe the service and API names and URIs.

    - _Note: This step will likely be done by the person who created the z/OS Connect Server, and not the person creating the API. It may be beneficial to simply provide the system administrator with the correct values to enter._
      _For the system administrator: if multiple DB2 APIs will be created, it is recommended to create an xml file dedicated to these resource definitions. Then use an "\<include>" statement in the server.xml to refer to this file._
      _For more information on \<include>: visit this [link](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4SVW_2.0.0/com.ibm.zosconnect.doc/highavailability/split_config_info.html)._

  - Some sample code to add to the server.xml file is below:
    ![Server.xml Sample Code](doc/source/images/ServerXMLSampleCode.png)

  - Open the server.xml file

  - Add two stanzas like those in the code sample above, customizing for the specific service name and other details about the service and API:

    - a) The invokeURI is often the same as the base path specified in the API creation (it may be the same as the service name).
    - b) The connectionRefName should match a value that is created by the person who manages the server.xml file. It can be found in the stanza marked \<zosconnect*zosConnectServiceRestClientConnection>. <br/>
      *(This was also entered in the properties file when creating the .sar)\_
    - c) The URI should match the one used in the properties file in the "Creating a .sar file" section
    - d) The default value of the httpMethod is POST. Leave this as is.

  - Save the server.xml file.

  - **You are now ready to test your API.**

  - ### Testing the API using the z/OS Connect API Toolkit

    - Now that you have created your REST service, created your API and deployed your API, you are ready to test the API. <br/> This can be done either using the API Toolkit’s SwaggerUI tooling or using the same REST Client that you used when creating your REST Service. These instructions walk through using the SwaggerUI tooling.

    - Click on the **z/OS Connect Servers** tab (typically in the bottom left corner) and ensure that the icon next to your server is green (![z/OS Connect Server Tab Icon](doc/source/images/ZOSConnectServerTabIcon.png)) indicating that you are connected to the server.

      - **To see the API:** <br/> _Click the triangle next to the APIs folder to see all the folders that are deployed on the server._ <br/> (To get the uri associated with the API, left-click on the API name and a tab will appear to the right. You can use this uri with the tool of your choice.)
        ![To See the APIs](doc/source/images/ToSeeTheAPIs.png)

    - **Testing the API:**

      - Right click on the API name and a popup menu will appear. Choose **Open In SwaggerUI**.
        ![OpenInSwaggerUI](doc/source/images/OpenInSwaggerUI.png)

      - A new tab will appear on the right
        ![Swagger UI Tab](doc/source/images/SwaggerUITab.png)

      - Click **Expand Operations** <br/> Scroll down, and you will see the area where you can input sample values
        ![InputSampleValues](doc/source/images/InputSampleValues.png)

      - Enter a test value, scroll down the page and click the TRY IT OUT button
        ![Try It Out Button](doc/source/images/TryItOutButton.png)

      - Scroll down and Response content can be found.
        ![ResponseContentExample](doc/source/images/ResponseContentExample.png)

**If the test is successful, you are done!**
