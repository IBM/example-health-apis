# 9. Importing and Managing an API from z/OS Connect in API Connect

## Pre-requisites

This part assumes that an API has been created using z/OS Connect. The requirements for managing the API using API Connect are:

1. An IBM Cloud Account
2. The API Connect Feature enabled on the IBM Cloud Account
3. Access to the API description file (swagger.json) associated with the API or the URL and credentials to reach the API description document online.

## Background

The screen shots used in this part are based on a IBM Cloud hosted instance of API Connect and will be calling a previously created API (that was created with z/OS Connect).

Below is a pictorial view of z/OS Connect and API Connect working together. The green boxes represent Open API Specification (aka Swagger) documents.
