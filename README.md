# z/OS Connect & API Connect Code Pattern for Summit Health

This code pattern shows you how to expose data from a DB2 database and a CICS application through z/OS Connect and then create APIs to access that data with API Connect.

This work was done as part of the Summit Health set of code patterns, which demonstrate how cloud technology can access data stored on z/OS Systems. We needed a way to access the large amounts of data stored on a DB2 database and a CICS application. We used z/OS Connect and API Connect to expose the data through REST APIs. z/OS Connect provides a single, common way to unleash your existing market-differentiating assets on IBM with RESTful APIs. API Connect allows automated API creation, simple discovery of assets, self-service access for developers, and built-in security and governance. z/OS Connect was used first to expose the data from DB2 and CICS as REST APIs. Then API Connect was used to create a way for developers to easily access the APIs through an intuitive portal.

This code pattern is for people with an intermediate understand and experience working with Z Systems, z/OS and tools like z/OS Explorer.

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

- Use z/OS Connect to expose CICS and DB2 Data with REST APIs
- Use API Connect to manage your APIs and create a portal for developers to access them

### Pre-requisites

- In order to create a DB2 RESTful servoce, the system pre-requisite is to have DB2 v11 or v12 with associated PTFs for REST API support. (Info on APARs here:<br/> http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1II14827 )

- The Service Creator will also need to hace some sort of REST client tool. That can be in the form of a browser plug-in (such as Rest Client for Firefox or Advanced Rest Client for Chrome) or a desktop too such as SoapUI.

- The **z/OS Connect Build Toolkit** will be needed for the .sar file generation. This tool can be run either on the mainframe (omvs) or in a Windows command interface. These instractions do so on Windows. <br/> The build toolkit is packaged as a zip file and cab be obtained here: <br/> https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/zos-connect-ee-build-toolkit/

## Flow

This is how your APIs will be routed from your backend systems to a developer friendly portal.

  |   **Table**   |                                                                      **Description**                                                                       |
  | :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
  |    PATIENT    |                                     Holds basic patient information (name, contact information, insurance card number)                                     |
  |     USER      |                                                      Holds patient credentials for login into system                                                       |
  |  MEDICATION   |                                                     General registry of medications and valid dosages                                                      |
  |  MEDITATION   |                                                   Record of any meditation sessions held with a patient                                                    |
  | PRESCRIPTION  |                                     Record of medications prescribed to a patient, with prescription period and dosage                                     |
  |   THRESHOLD   |                                      Most recent heart rate and blood pressure for a patient. One entry per patient.                                       |
  |   HEARTRATE   |                                                Log of patient heart rate when measured at a doctor's visit                                                 |
  | BLOODPRESSURE |                                              Log of patient blood pressure when measured at a doctor's visit                                               |

  | OBSERVATIONS  | Log of patient measurements (such as height and weight), lab results (like cholesterol and blood sugar) and questionnaire answers (such as smoking status) |

- Seven (7) of the tables are used in the Web Interface:

  - PATIENT

  - USER

  - MEDICATION

  - PRESCRIPTION

  - APPOINTMENTS

  - ALLERGIES

  - OBSERVATIONS

- Create the tables for the functions that will be implemented in the Healthcare system.

  - The tables should be created in the table space that was defined to contain the Healthcare tables

  - Once the database and tables are created, a BIND needs to take place to connect the CICS application and the database.

- The commands for creating the database tables are listed in this [PDF](doc/source/CreateTableStatements.pdf)

## 4. Populate DB2 database with Synthea data

- Visit this [code pattern](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/transform-load-big-data-csv-files-db2-zos-database/) for the instructions on populating your DB2 database with data from the Synthea tool

## 5. Expose DB2 data through z/OS Connect

- ### Creating a DB2 Service

  - To verify that REST Services have been installed on your system, you can enter this into the address for your browser: [http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/](http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/). There will be a result on the screen showing something like the box below:<br/>
    ![DB2 Service Install Check](doc/source/images/DB2ServiceInstallCheck.png)<br/>
    _REST services for DB2 are defined either using a DB2 provided REST administrative service (DB2ServiceManager) or by using the DB2 BIND command using an update provided in DB2 PTF UI51748. There instructions walk through doing so using the RESTful administrative service._

  - Open the REST Client tool of your choice (for example, we will be usign a Firefoc browser plug-in).

  - Choose the Header with a **Content-Type** of **application/json**
    ![REST Client Request Header](doc/source/images/RESTClientRequestHeader.png)

  - Choose the POST method and use the url <br/> http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/DB2ServiceManager

  - Modify the following stanza with the values for your service and paste it into the Body section (be sure to keep the requestType as "createService"):
    ![Modified Stanza](doc/source/images/ModifiedStanza.png)

  - Click **SEND**
    ![Click SEND](doc/source/images/ClickSEND.png)

  - If the command works, you will get an HTTP 201 response (which means that the call was successful and something was created).

  - In the Response, the new url for the service you created will be listed.
    ![RequestResponseForNewService](doc/source/images/RequestResponseForNewService.png)

  - You have just created a service.

    _Note: If you want to verify that the service exists later, you can use that same url that was listed in the verification step (http://my.db2.ip.addr:port/services/) to show you the services that exist on your DB2 system._

  - #### Testing a DB2 Service

    If you want to see if this service call works, you can do so with the REST client.

    - Make sure to use the POST method and the Header with Content-Type of application/json
    - Copy the url for the service and paste it into the URL field (you can get this from the listing of services using the note above)
    - Include any parameters you need to pass for the service in the "Body" section.
    - Click SEND
      ![Testing A DB2 Service](doc/source/images/TestingADB2Service.png)

  - #### Deleteing a DB2 Service

    If you made a mistake when you created your service or need to delete it for any reason, modify the stanza below and follow the first 5 parts of the Creating a DB2 Service step.
    ![Deleting a DB2 Service](doc/source/images/DeletingADB2Service.png)

## 6. Create CICS Application

- A sample CICS application is included in this code pattern. The application is known as HCAZ. It is a simple CICS application for inputing and retrieving healthcare information.

- The source code is included in the [HCAZ_Source](HCAZ_Source) folder.

- The source code includes JCL files to install the application. Some changes may need to be made to the JCL depending on your installation. If you have any questions ask your organization's zSystem Programmer or a zSystem Developer.

## 7. Expose CICS Application data through z/OS Connect

## 8. Create API Connect Instance

- Create an IBM Cloud Account

  - [Click here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) to go to the IBM Cloud registration page.

  - Enter your email, first name, last name, Country or Region, and the password you would like to use.

  ![IBM Cloud Create Account](doc/source/images/IBMCloudCreateAccount.gif)

- Create an API Connect Instance

  - From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, click on **Catalog**.

  - In the search bar tyep **"API Connect"** and hit **enter**.

  - Click on the API Connect card.

  - Name the service. Choose a location to deploy in (Choose the locatino closest to you). Leave the organization and space at the defaults. Scroll down and select the **"Lite"** plan. The click the **Create** button.
